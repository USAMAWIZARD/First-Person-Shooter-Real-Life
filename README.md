## First Person Shotter Real Life
Build a game in  C++ Unreal Engine manuplating a wepen in real time based on the accelorometer and magnetometer data from the mobile.
I build a flutter udp client app which sends acclerometer and magnetometer data to specified IP Address and Port number.
This raw data is being recived by the UDP server in Unreal Engine and based on the values the orientation of the gun is manuplated.

## Motivation
One Day I was just playing around with my little brother he was pointing his hand making  gun guesture against me and yelling the gun shooting noices.
so i thought why not make someting similar to this so i came up with an idea  of  using a mobile as a gun and manuplating the gun object in the game based on mobile orientation.
